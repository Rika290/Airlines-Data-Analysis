Airlines Data Analysis

- Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction

- A Power BI dashboard is created to analyse and understand:
  
1. distribution of flights based on airlines, their classes, cities, stops and timing
2. how each airline's ticket price varies with each other
3. whether the price and duration is related to each other or not
4. how the price is distributed between each class- Business and Economy
5. distribution of price based on cities
6. top 3 airlines based on their ticket price

- Different charts and graphs based on the data types were used to build this dashboard.
  
This analysis will be helpful to track the availability and performance of each airline.
